# SurfaceBrightness
The Goal of this porject is to adjust the screen brightness by pressing and holding the volume button

Features:

-Hold Volume Up/Down to adjust screen brightness
-Toast Notifications at Highest and Lowest setting

Though about making this when went outside on a sunny day with my Surface tablet and didn't have anyways to change the brightness so I could see the screen in the sunlight.

Future goals:

-Work out the bugs in the script
-Hide Cmd prompt that keeps popping up/flashing
-option to switch brightness trigger to double tapping volume keys
